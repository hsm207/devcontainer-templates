# Devcontainer Templates

This repository contains a collection of development container (dev container) templates that I commonly use for learning and contributing to other open-source software (OSS) projects. These templates are particularly useful for projects that have complicated setup steps but do not provide dev containers out of the box.

## What are dev containers?

According to the [Dev containers website](https://containers.dev/):

> "A development container (or dev container for short) allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud, in a variety of supporting tools and editors."

In essence, dev containers are a feature supported by Visual Studio Code that allows you to define your development environment as code. This means you can share, replicate, and version control your development environment just like you do with your source code.

## Why Use dev containers?

Setting up a development environment for a new project can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. With dev containers, you can automate this process and ensure that everyone on your team (or anyone contributing to your project) has the same consistent, reproducible development environment.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a dev container configuration that you find useful and think others might benefit from, feel free to open a pull request.
